# interfaces-are-ready
#
# The JOB is a trigger and indicating, that
# we have got the event about interfaces' rediness.
# The interface used for PXE already is down and
# udev can rename it (if requested)
#
# It's not a task, so it will be at running state
# (task passes all states to the stopped)
#
